# Secrious Code Snippets

A collection of vulnerable and secure code snippets that were used as one method to help evaluate the
level of knowledge of code security of our participants.

Participants were given a set of 3 code snippets and were asked to select the most secure snippet and
explain why. In this repository, code snippets are categorised by type of vulnerability/attack with sets
of three snippets located in a numbered folder, for example:

- XSS
  - 1 (first set of 3)
    - Vulnerable Snippet 1
    - Vulnerable Snippet 2
    - Secure Snippet
  - 2
    - ... (and so on)
    - ...

Feel free to submit pull requests if you wish to add more and contribute to our list of vulnerable and secure
snippets to test cybersecurity knowledge on coder security!
